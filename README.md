# Deploying scaffoldhub.io on AWS using Elastic Beanstalk

These are just my notes to help move towards being able to deploy scaffoldhub.io applications on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
No warranties or promise of completeness to be found here - use at your own risk!

Feel free to file pull requests!

The instructions assume that you have the scaffoldhub.io zip file unpacked into your local folder ``` ~/your-application/```, that you have everything in a git repo (this is important for the eb cli for the backend to work).
